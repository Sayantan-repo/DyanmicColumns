# DyanmicColumns
Implement Dynamic Columns in jQuery Data Table
This project is build on ASP.NET MVC, jQuery , C# and SQL SERVER.
In this sample project I have implemented how the table columns and their respective data can be included or excluded dyamically.
This project can be further customized to user specific table view where a user can choose which column they want to see and in
what order they want to see.
I have shared all the necessary files that are required to build this.I have also shared an screenshot of the project structure and 
the SQL script.
In one of the screenshot that I have shared shows a modal with some column name in the Inculded and Excluded List.When a user drags
and drop the columns from Included to Excluded list or viceversa, the Columns that are present in the Included list will appear in the
DataTable and those in the Excluded list will not appear.
Hope this helps someone so that they can reuse the code or the idea to implement this functionality in their own customized way.
In case of any issue or query please feel free to reach me at sayantan.chakraborty@indusnet.co.in.
